Given a two-dimensional square matrix (n x n), rotate the matrix 90 degrees to the right (clockwise). 

Example 1:

Input:

[
  [ 1,  2,  3, 4],

  [ 5,  6,  7, 8],

  [ 9, 10, 11, 12],

  [13, 14, 15, 16]

],

Output:

[
 [13,  9, 5, 1],

 [14, 10, 6, 2],

 [15, 11, 7, 3],

 [16, 12, 8, 4]
]

Example 2:

Input:

[[10, 20],

  [30, 40]
],

Output:

[
[30, 10],

[40, 20]
]

Challenge:

Can you do the rotation in-place?
